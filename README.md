Hello! Welcome to the REFLOC project page. REFLOC refers to "Recycling flows of concrete". In this project, we explored the French national concrete waste treatment dynamics during 2025 and 2095 using a combination of dynamic material flow analysis and life cycle analysis. The environmental impacts (climate change and particulate matter) are evaluated for the treatment of total concrete waste for the 10-year period.
