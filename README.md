# DdS_REFLOC

Hello! Welcome to the REFLOC project page. REFLOC refers to "Recycling flows of concrete". In this project, we explored the national concrete waste treatment dynamics during 2025 and 2095 using dynamic material flow analysis, and coupled with life cycle analysis to calculate the environmental impact of a combination of different treatment strategies.
